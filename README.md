## Income inequality<br>
#### Income inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income among individuals or households within a society. It is typically measured by comparing the distribution of income across various segments of a population, often using metrics such as the Gini coefficient or the ratio of income shares held by different groups.<br>
#### Factors contributing to income inequality include differences in education, skill levels, employment opportunities, discrimination, tax policies, globalization, technological advancements, and shifts in labor markets. <br>
